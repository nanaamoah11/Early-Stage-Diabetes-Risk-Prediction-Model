# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction-Model

### Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting early-stage diabetes risk in individuals. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective management and prevention of complications. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can build a predictive model that analyzes various health parameters to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes at an early stage.

### Data Preprocessing: 
The dataset is preprocessed to transform categorical variables into a numerical format, ensuring compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
### Model Development:
Machine learning algorithm used was a Logistic Regression Model.
### Evaluation Metrics: 
The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure robustness and reliability.
### Deployment: 
The final trained model is deployed within a Gradio interface.
